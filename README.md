Slides etc for "A New XZ Every Day" as presented at BSides SLC, 2025-04-11.

Will post video if/when it's available.

The PDF in this repo will download but if you try to view it in-browser you may get some weird "Unable to render code block" error from GitHub. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it really is messed up I will also have the slides in my personal domain: https://novarese.net/talks/

My other slides etc are cataloged in https://github.com/pvnovarese/talks

See also my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/novarese/) and [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@pvn) profiles.
